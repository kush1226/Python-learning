Assignment: 06.1 -  math quiz
Date: 03/03/2025

Description:
    The program is to give the user a simple division problem to solve. The program should then allow the user to enter the answer. 

Contributors:
    Name, login@purdue.edu [repeat for each]
My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
